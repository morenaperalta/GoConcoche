# GoConcoche
## Intro
Welcome to the backend API GoConCoche, a web app designed to let user register and rent out their 
car (or fleet of cars) or rent a car.
The system enables users to search for, book, and manage car-sharing reservations at specific 
locations. It allows car owners to manage their rental offers and it provides administrators with tools 
to oversee vehicle fleets and booking rules. It also includes advanced features such as secure 
authentication using JWT. The project is implemented using Java 21, Maven, and MySQL, with a strong 
focus on modularity, security, and efficiency. A key constraint for this API is that the ability to 
search for available vehicles is protected and available only for registered users, as per customer 
request, therefore prioritizing a secure, registered-user-only experience from the very first step.

## Database Schema
